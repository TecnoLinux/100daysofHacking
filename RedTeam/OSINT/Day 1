# Day 1 of OSINT 

Image Location

Before we can apply a tool or a methodology for finding the location of an image, we should use our eyes to scan the image for important information. Extracting key data points from the image will allow you to apply the right tool, craft a good Google search or identify which part of the world the image might have been taken in. 
There are 5 elements of IMINT that you should consider when looking at an image, according to Geoint expert Benjamin Strick:
- Context
- Foreground
- Background
- Map markings
- Trial and error

Here are some questions you should ask yourself while looking at the upcoming challenges:

- Are there any obvious data in the image that reveals the location, like a street name or storefront signs?
- Can you determine the country or region of the image by, for instance, which side of the road they drive on, language or architectural characteristics that may reveal a country or continent/region?  
- Do you recognize road sign styles, nature and environmental characteristics, or popular motor vehicle brands or vehicle types? 
- What is the quality of any visible infrastructure like? Is the road paved or do you see gravel roads? 
- Do you see any unique landmarks, buildings, bridges, statues or mountains that can help you geolocate the image?
